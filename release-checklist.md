# Release Checklist

There are two different release checklists available from within the [`
wp-cli/wp-cli`
](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli) repository:

* Generate a [ðŸš€ Regular Release Checklist]() - applies to major (1.x.x) and minor (x.1.x) releases
* Generate a [ðŸ”§ Patch Release Checklist]() - applies to patch (x.x.1) releases only

As a first step for initiating a release process, the corresponding checklist should be generated and added to the milestone it relates to.
