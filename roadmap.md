# Roadmap

WP-CLI is released every 3-4 months, typically around the beta period of [WordPress's release cycle](https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/):

* Current: [v2.0.0](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/milestone/55?closed=1) (August 8, 2018)

Patch versions are released on an as-needed basis, usually to address bugs or regressions. The current version of WP-CLI is the only officially supported version.

Just like WordPress has plugins, the future of WP-CLI is packages of commands. WP-CLI's current product focus is to:

* Help packages be considered first-class citizens amongst the commands bundled with WP-CLI (in build quality, documentation, test coverage, and discoverability).
* Encourage package maintenance to be a communal activity, instead of falling upon a single person.

New features are developed as packages first. Doing so enables:

* Faster feature iteration with less risk.
* More contribution opportunities.
* Reduced complexity and maintenance burden for the core project.
